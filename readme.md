## Project Description

Customer attrition is a prevalent problem for many businesses, resulting in large financial losses. We intend to investigate customer churn or attrition in this project, which refers to the percentage of consumers that discontinue using a company's product or service within a specified time frame. Understanding the primary causes of customer churn can assist businesses in developing effective retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and boost revenue.

This project's dataset includes information about users' demographics, service usage, and billing information. We will use this dataset to conduct an exploratory data analysis in order to find patterns and trends linked to customer attrition. We will next use machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that will estimate the likelihood of a customer leaving the firm.
